S&P 500 Index Stock Data Analysis and Prediction

Overview
--------
This project focuses on downloading, cleaning, and visualizing stock data for the S&P 500 Index, followed by training and improving a machine learning model to predict stock price movements. The steps include evaluating prediction errors and improving the model with additional predictor columns for better accuracy over long periods of time.

Steps
-----

1. Download S&P 500 Stock Data
   - Fetch stock data for the S&P 500 Index.
   - Use Python libraries (e.g., yfinance, pandas) to retrieve and manage historical stock data.

2. Data Cleaning and Visualization
   - Clean the dataset by removing or imputing missing values and handling outliers.
   - Visualize trends, correlations, and key features using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn.

3. Setting Up Machine Learning Target
   - Define a target variable for the machine learning model (e.g., price movement, daily returns, etc.).
   - Create labels based on the defined target for training the model.

4. Train Initial Machine Learning Model
   - Choose and implement a baseline model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
   - Train the model on historical stock data and predict future stock movements.

5. Error Evaluation and Backtesting
   - Evaluate the model's error using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Implement a backtesting system to test the model's performance over long periods of time and measure its prediction accuracy.

6. Model Improvement with Extra Predictors
   - Improve the model by adding extra predictor columns, such as moving averages, trading volumes, technical indicators, and macroeconomic data.
   - Retrain and validate the model to check for improvements in prediction accuracy.

Requirements
------------
- Python 3.x
- yfinance
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Usage
-----
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sp500-stock-analysis.git
   cd sp500-stock-analysis

2. Install required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the data analysis and model training scripts.

Future Work
-----------
- Explore additional machine learning models and techniques (e.g., neural networks).
- Include real-time data feeds for continuous backtesting.
- Improve the model's ability to generalize to different market conditions.
